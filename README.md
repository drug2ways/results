# Results
Applications and validation analyses shown in the manuscript

## Networks
The two network files used in the case scenario.

## Validation
To validate the disease-drug pairs prioritized by Drug2ways, we used clinical trial information (i.e., drugs that have
been tested on a given indication) from [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/) mapped to each of the networks.
